# Three-Level Password System
The Three-Level Password System is a Java-based authentication application designed to enhance security by requiring users to successfully pass through three distinct levels of verification: password, PIN, and CAPTCHA.

## Features
Multi-Level Authentication:

Password Verification: Users must provide a valid password associated with their username.
PIN Verification: An additional layer of security requires users to enter a personal identification number (PIN).
CAPTCHA Verification: Users must correctly solve a CAPTCHA to prove they are human.
Sample User Database:

The system uses an in-memory HashMap to store users' credentials (passwords and PINs) for quick access.
